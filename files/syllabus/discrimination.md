### Discrimination, Harassment, and Sexual Harassment

Kansas State University is committed to maintaining academic, housing, and work environments that are free of discrimination, harassment, and sexual harassment. Instructors support the University’s commitment by creating a safe learning environment during this course, free of conduct that would interfere with your academic opportunities. Instructors also have a [duty to report](https://www.k-state.edu/oie/faqs.html) any behavior they become aware of that potentially violates the University’s policy prohibiting discrimination, harassment, and sexual harassment ([PPM 3010](https://www.k-state.edu/policies/ppm/3000/3010.html)).  

If a student is subjected to discrimination, harassment, or sexual harassment, they are encouraged to make a non-confidential report to the University’s [Office for Institutional Equity (OIE)](https://www.k-state.edu/oie/) using the [online reporting form](https://cm.maxient.com/reportingform.php?KansasStateUniv&layout_id=34). Incident disclosure is not required to receive resources at K-State. Reports that include domestic and dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking, should be considered for reporting by the complainant to the [Kansas State University Police Department](https://www.k-state.edu/police/suggest/) or the [Riley County Police Department](https://www.rileycountypolice.org/). Reports made to law enforcement are separate from reports made to OIE. A complainant can choose to report to one or both entities. Confidential support and advocacy can be found with the [K-State Center for Advocacy, Response, and Education (CARE)](https://www.k-state.edu/care/). Confidential mental health services can be found with Lafene [Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS)](https://www.k-state.edu/counseling/). Academic support can be found with the [Office of Student Life (OSL)](https://www.k-state.edu/studentlife/). OSL is a non-confidential resource. A comprehensive list of resources is available [here](https://www.k-state.edu/oie/resources.html). If you have questions about non-confidential and confidential resources, please contact OIE at equity@ksu.edu or (785) 532–6220.
