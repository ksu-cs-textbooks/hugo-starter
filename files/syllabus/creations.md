### Student Academic Creations

Student academic creations are subject to Kansas State University and Kansas Board of Regents Intellectual Property Policies. For courses in which students will be creating intellectual property, the K-State policy can be found at University Handbook, Appendix R: [Intellectual Property Policy and Institutional Procedures (part I.E.)](https://www.k-state.edu/provost/universityhb/fhxr.html). These policies address ownership and use of student academic creations.
