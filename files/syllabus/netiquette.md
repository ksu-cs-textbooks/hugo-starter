### Netiquette

{{% notice info %}}

This is our personal policy and not a required syllabus statement from K-State. It has been adapted from [this statement](https://global.k-state.edu/students/courses/netiquette/) from K-State Global Campus, and the[Recurse Center Manual](https://www.recurse.com/manual). We have adapted their ideas to fit this course.

Online communication is inherently different than in-person communication. When speaking in person, many times we can take advantage of the _context_ and _body language_ of the person speaking to better understand what the speaker _means_, not just what is said. This information is not present when communicating online, so we must be much more careful about what we say and how we say it in order to get our meaning across.

Here are a few general rules to help us all communicate online in this course, especially while using tools such as Canvas or Discord:

* **Use a clear and meaningful subject line to announce your topic.** Subject lines such as "Question" or "Problem" are not helpful. Subjects such as "Logic Question in Project 5, Part 1 in Java" or "Unexpected Exception when Opening Text File in Python" give plenty of information about your topic.
* **Use only one topic per message.** If you have multiple topics, post multiple messages so each one can be discussed independently.
* **Be thorough, concise, and to the point.** Ideally, each message should be a page or less.
* **Include exact error messages, code snippets, or screenshots, as well as any previous steps taken to fix the problem.** It is much easier to solve a problem when the exact error message or screenshot is provided. If we know what you've tried so far, we can get to the root cause of the issue more quickly.
* **Consider carefully what you write before you post it.** Once a message is posted, it becomes part of the permanent record of the course and can easily be found by others.
* **If you are lost, don't know an answer, or don't understand something, speak up!** Email and Canvas both allow you to send a message privately to the instructors, so other students won't see that you asked a question. Don't be afraid to ask questions anytime, as you can choose to do so without any fear of being identified by your fellow students.
* **Class discussions are confidential.** Do not share information from the course with anyone outside of the course without explicit permission.
* **Do not quote entire message chains; only include the relevant parts.** When replying to a previous message, only quote the relevant lines in your response.
* **Do not use all caps.** It makes it look like you are shouting. Use appropriate text markup (bold, italics, etc.) to highlight a point if needed.
* **No feigning surprise.** If someone asks a question, saying things like "I can't believe you don't know that!" are not helpful, and only serve to make that person feel bad.
* **No "well-actually's."** If someone makes a statement that is not entirely correct, resist the urge to offer a "well, actually..." correction, especially if it is not relevant to the discussion. If you can help solve their problem, feel free to provide correct information, but don't post a correction just for the sake of being correct.
* **Do not correct someone's grammar or spelling.** Again, it is not helpful, and only serves to make that person feel bad. If there is a genuine mistake that may affect the meaning of the post, please contact the person privately or let the instructors know privately so it can be resolved.
* **Avoid subtle -isms and microaggressions.** Avoid comments that could make others feel uncomfortable based on their personal identity. See the syllabus section on Diversity and Inclusion above for more information on this topic. If a comment makes you uncomfortable, please contact the instructor.
* **Avoid sarcasm, flaming, advertisements, lingo, trolling, doxxing, and other bad online habits.** They have no place in an academic environment. Tasteful humor is fine, but sarcasm can be misunderstood.

As a participant in course discussions, you should also strive to honor the diversity of your classmates by adhering to the [K-State Principles of Community](https://www.k-state.edu/about/values/community/).
